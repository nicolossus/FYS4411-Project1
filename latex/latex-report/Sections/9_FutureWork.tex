In the present work we have built an automated VMC framework for bosonic systems. Building off of the present work, an interesting avenue for further research would be to generalize the automatic differentiation procedures to also apply to interacting systems. Moreover, the framework should be fairly easy to expand to be able to handle fermionic systems as well. There are also partially unanswered questions regarding the difference in the correlations between the samples generated by the two sampling algorithms, like an estimate for a factor of additional samples needed to generate the same statistical error using the RWM, when we know the statistical error for LMH with a given samples size, or the number of steps between uncorrelated samples for each algorithm. An implementation of an unsupervised machine learning method, like a \textit{restricted Boltzmann machine} based on the same sampler, will be implemented for further analysis of the bosonic system in project 2.
