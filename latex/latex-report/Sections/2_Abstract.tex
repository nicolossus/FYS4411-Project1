In this project, we build a variational Monte Carlo method to estimate the ground state energy of an ultracold, dilute Bose gas in harmonic traps. We use a trial wave function composed of a single particle Gaussian with a single variational parameter and a hard sphere Jastrow factor for pair correlations. We consider two Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms; a random walk Metropolis with Gaussian proposals and a Langevin Metropolis-Hastings with proposals driven according to the gradient flow of the probability density of the trial wave function. The methods are implemented in a Python framework with automatic differentiation, procedures for tuning scale parameters and gradient descent optimizations of the variational parameter. The blocking method, which accounts for the autocorrelation of a Markov chain, is used to calculate the statistical error of the variational energy. The implementation is verified by comparison with closed-form expressions available when we consider a system of non-interacting bosons only. We find that ... WHICH IS BETTER? RMW OR LMH? AD TIME VS ANALYTICAL? ETC... Our framework provides a solid foundation for building a more general variational Monte Carlo method that can handle more complex systems.
