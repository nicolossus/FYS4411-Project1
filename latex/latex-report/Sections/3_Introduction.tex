Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), predicted in 1924 by Einstein [cite] on the basis of the quantum formulations of Bose [cite], is a state of matter in which a large fraction of an ultracold, low density gas of particles with integer spin, i.e., bosons, simultaneously occupy the lowest quantum state. 

Observed in experiments with ultracold, dilute alkali gases in 1995, notably Rubidium-87
