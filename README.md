# FYS4411 - Computational Physics II: Quantum Mechanical Systems

## Project 1:

This repository contains programs, material and report for project 1 in FYS4411 made in collaboration between [JÃ¸rn Eirik](https://github.com/JornEirikBetten), [Nicolai](https://github.com/nicolossus) and [Aleksandar](https://github.com/aleksda).

In this project, we build a variational Monte Carlo method to estimate the ground state energy of an ultracold, dilute Bose gas in harmonic traps. We use a trial wave function composed of a single particle Gaussian with a single variational parameter and a hard sphere Jastrow factor for pair correlations. We consider two Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms; a random walk Metropolis with Gaussian proposals and a Langevin Metropolis-Hastings with proposals driven according to the gradient flow of the probability density of the trial wave function. The methods are implemented in a Python framework with automatic differentiation, procedures for tuning scale parameters and gradient descent optimizations of the variational parameter. The blocking method, which accounts for the autocorrelation of a Markov chain, is used to calculate the statistical error of the variational energy. Our `vmc` package can be found in the [src directory](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS4411-Project1/tree/main/src).
